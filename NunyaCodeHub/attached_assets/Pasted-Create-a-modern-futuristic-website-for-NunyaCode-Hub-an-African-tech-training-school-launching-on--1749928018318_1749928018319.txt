Create a modern, futuristic website for NunyaCode Hub, an African tech training school launching on July 7, 2025, focused on empowering tech talent across Africa. The website will be hosted on GitHub Pages and developed exclusively using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no external frameworks like React or Bootstrap). The design should reflect NunyaCode Hub’s mission to nurture growth (“nunya” from the Ewe word meaning “Knowledge”), with a strong emphasis on Data Analytics and Web Design courses, while hinting at future offerings (Cybersecurity, UI/UX, Networking).
Design Goals
Aesthetic: Embrace a dark mode theme with a palette of #1a1f2e (deep space), #2e4374 (tech blue), #4a2c6f (purple depth), and #00ffcc (vibrant green accent), aligning with 2025’s low-light UI trend.
Trends to Incorporate:
Dark Mode & Low-Light UI: Prioritize eye comfort and aesthetic appeal for late-night learners.
AI-Driven Personalization: Suggest courses (e.g., Data Analytics for problem-solvers) based on user input.
3D Elements & Immersive Experiences: Use 3D animations (e.g., tech nodes) or AR previews for course samples.
Sustainable Design: Optimize assets (e.g., WebP images) and lean code for reduced carbon footprint.
Micro-Interactions: Add subtle animations (e.g., button hovers, field highlights) for engagement.
Bold Typography & Organic Shapes: Use expressive fonts (e.g., Orbitron) and asymmetrical layouts with Adinkra-inspired curves.
Scroll-Based Storytelling: Reveal content dynamically (e.g., roadmap steps) as users scroll.
Minimalism with Purposeful Whitespace: Ensure clean layouts to focus on course content.
Cultural Identity: Include subtle African design hints (e.g., circular SVG patterns inspired by Adinkra symbols) without overwhelming the tech style.
Responsiveness: Adopt a mobile-first approach with a seamless experience across devices.
Accessibility: Ensure WCAG 2.1 compliance with high-contrast options and ARIA labels.
Target Audience
Tech enthusiasts and learners across Africa (62% mobile traffic), aged 18-35, seeking practical, job-ready skills with a focus on Data Analytics and Web Design. The design should appeal to a youthful, interactive audience while supporting late-night study habits.
